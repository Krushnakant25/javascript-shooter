# javascript-shooter

This is a fun and simple 2D plane shooting game built with **HTML5**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. In this game, you control a plane, shoot down enemies, and avoid obstacles while trying to survive as long as possible. The game gets harder the longer you play with faster enemies and increased difficulty. 

I built this project as part of my learning journey in web development, and it was a lot of fun to make!

## How to Play
- Use the **Arrow Keys** to move the plane up, down, left, and right.
- Press the **Spacebar** to shoot lasers at enemy planes.
- Avoid crashing into enemy planes!
- Destroy enemies to get points and survive as long as possible!

## Features
- **Simple 2D graphics** with HTML5 canvas.
- **Player movement** and shooting mechanics.
- **Enemies** that spawn randomly and move toward the player.
- **Collisions** between lasers, enemies, and the player.
- **Explosions and sound effects** when enemies are destroyed or the player crashes.
- **Increasing difficulty** as the game progresses.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5 Canvas**: For drawing the game world and player graphics.
- **JavaScript**: For the game logic, animations, and interactions.
- **CSS**: For basic styling of the page.
- **Sound and Images**: Custom assets used for the plane, enemies, and effects (sounds for laser shots, explosions, and game over).

## How to Run the Game
